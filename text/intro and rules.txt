You escaped from the PoW camp and safety is just
a stones-throw away... Right accross this deadly
minefield!

Walk accross the minefield using four direction
commands:
north, or n
south, or s
west, or w
east, or e

You can detonate mines which might be ahead of you with
the command "detonate" followed by your chosen direction. For
example you can detonate a mine to your north with the command
"detonate north/n" or "det north/n". Be careful though, you only have
a limited number of detonators!

Try not to die.
